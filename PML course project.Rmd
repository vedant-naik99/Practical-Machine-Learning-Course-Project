## Overview
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The data consists of a Training data and a Test data (to be used to validate the selected model).

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with.

Note: The dataset used in this project is a courtesy of “Ugulino, W.; Cardador, D.; Vega, K.; Velloso, E.; Milidiu, R.; Fuks, H. Wearable Computing: Accelerometers’ Data Classification of Body Postures and Movements”

## Getting and Cleaning Data

Calling the required packages
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
library(gbm)
```
```{r}
train_in <- read.csv('./pml-training.csv', header=T)
valid_in <- read.csv('./pml-testing.csv', header=T)
dim(train_in)
```
```{r}
dim(valid_in)
```
As shown below there are 19622 observations and 160 variables in the Training dataset.

  -We remove the variables that contains missing values. Note along the cleaning process we display the dimension of the reduced dataset

```{r}
trainData<- train_in[, colSums(is.na(train_in)) == 0]
validData <- valid_in[, colSums(is.na(valid_in)) == 0]
dim(trainData)
```
```{r}
dim(validData)
```
Removing the first seven variables as they have little impact on the outcome classe
```{r}
trainData <- trainData[, -c(1:7)]
validData <- validData[, -c(1:7)]
dim(trainData)
```
```{r}
dim(validData)
```
Preparing the data for prediction by splitting the training data into 70% as train data and 30% as test data. This splitting will server also to compute the out-of-sample errors.


  The test data renamed: valid_in (validate data) will stay as is and will be used later to test the prodction algorithm on the 20 cases.
```{r}
set.seed(1234) 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainData$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
trainData <- trainData[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainData[-inTrain, ]
dim(trainData)
```
```{r}
dim(testData)
```
Cleaning even further by removing the variables that are near-zero-variance
```{r}
NZV <- nearZeroVar(trainData)
trainData <- trainData[, -NZV]
testData  <- testData[, -NZV]
dim(trainData)
```
```{r}
dim(testData)
```
After this cleaning we are down now to 53 variables


  The following correlation plot uses the following parameters (source:CRAN Package ‘corrplot’) “FPC”: the first principal component order. “AOE”: the angular order tl.cex Numeric, for the size of text label (variable names) tl.col The color of text label.
```{r}
cor_mat <- cor(trainData[, -53])
corrplot(cor_mat, order = "FPC", method = "color", type = "upper", 
         tl.cex = 0.8, tl.col = rgb(0, 0, 0))
```
In the corrplot graph the correlated predictors (variables ) are those with a dark color intersection.

To obtain the names of the variables we do the following

we use the findCorrelation function to search for highly correlated attributes with a cut off equal to 0.75
```{r}
highlyCorrelated = findCorrelation(cor_mat, cutoff=0.75)
```
We then obtain the names of highly correlated attributes
```{r}
names(trainData)[highlyCorrelated]
```
###### Model building
For this project we will use two different algorithms, classification trees and random forests, to predict the outcome.

 1.classification trees
 2.random forests
 3.Generalized Boosted Model

  We first obtail the model, and then we use the fancyRpartPlot() function to plot the classification tree as a dendogram.
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
decisionTreeMod1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(decisionTreeMod1)
```
We then validate the model “decisionTreeModel” on the testData to find out how well it performs by looking at the accuracy variable.

```{r}
predictTreeMod1 <- predict(decisionTreeMod1, testData, type = "class")
cmtree <- confusionMatrix(predictTreeMod1, testData$classe)
cmtree
```
Plotting matrix results
```{r}
plot(cmtree$table, col = cmtree$byClass, 
     main = paste("Decision Tree - Accuracy =", round(cmtree$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
We see that the accuracy rate of the model is low: 0.6967 and therefore the out-of-sample-error is about 0.3 which is considerable.

### Prediction with Random Forest
We first determine the model
```{r}
controlRF <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
modRF1 <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRF)
modRF1$finalModel
```
We then validate the model obtained model “modRF1” on the test data to find out how well it performs by looking at the Accuracy variable
```{r}
predictRF1 <- predict(modRF1, newdata=testData)
cmrf <- confusionMatrix(predictRF1, testData$classe)
cmrf
```
Let’s plot the model
```{r}
plot(modRF1)
```
```{r}
plot(cmrf$table, col = cmrf$byClass, main = paste("Random Forest Confusion Matrix: Accuracy =", round(cmrf$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
### Prediction with Generalized Boosted Regression Models
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
controlGBM <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 1)
modGBM  <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method = "gbm", trControl = controlGBM, verbose = FALSE)
modGBM$finalModel
```
```{r}
print(modGBM)
```
Validating the GBM model
```{r}
predictGBM <- predict(modGBM, newdata=testData)
cmGBM <- confusionMatrix(predictGBM, testData$classe)
cmGBM
```

## The accuracy rate using the random forest is very high: Accuracy : 0.9736 and therefore the *out-of-sample-error is equal to 0.0264*
## Applying the best model to the validation data
By comparing the accuracy rate values of the three models, it is clear the the ‘Random Forest’ model is the winner. So will use it on the validation data
```{r}
Results <- predict(modRF1, newdata=validData)
Results
```
